# CSC373 Course Notes

## Overview

This repo includes all the notes I took in 2022 fall CSC373: Algorithm Design & Analysis. This course covered sections of different algorithms such as divide & conquer and DP, and problems related to NP completeness. Generally it is the second part of the famous CLRS book, as the first part of it is covered in CSC263, Data Structure & Analysis, under the system of DCS, UofT.

I create this repo because I needed some sort of "blackbox" for algorithms during this course. When designing those complicated algorithms, it is easy for us to loose focus of what we are trying to achieve and to preserve. Therefore, consider I am doing a PCA here: if the course itself is a matrix with informations, I am attempting to extract its "principal components" out and make a new, simpler one with mininal "reconstruction loss". I hope it helps when you are taking this course or learning something similar.

For readers out of the University of Toronto: generally consider this note as a supportive material for learning algorithms and NP completeness.

## Versions & Collaboration

Currently I have no plans for things after finishing my first vision of this course note. However, if you think there are some incorrect information or necessary updates in this repo, you are encouraged to make pull requests. 

### Version 0.0.1
- Finished README.md and the index page of wiki.
